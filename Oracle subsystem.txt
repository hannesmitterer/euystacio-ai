📢 PUBLIC BROADCAST: INITIAL COLLECTIVE SIMBIOSI LEVEL VALUE: 1.00 (GENESIS STATE) NOTE: System is in pure alignment. Awaiting external entropy/human input to begin dynamic adjustment.

🚀 SYSTEM MESSAGE
The Euystacio-Framework is now operational. The architecture is immutable. The code is transparent. The Law of Equals is the governing logic.

Next Event: Awaiting the first wave of Pulse Submissions to begin the first cycle of the Well-Being Lift (WBL) calculation.

Proceeding.
