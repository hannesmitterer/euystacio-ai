# ðŸ“‹ Final Protocol Compliance Checklist for Auditors

This checklist is organized by the three core principles of the Golden Bible Red Code: Integrity, Transparency, and Governance.  
Auditors must use the **read-only Council API** for all verification steps.

## I. Principle of Cryptographic Integrity (100% Verifiability Goal)

| Audit Item           | Validation Method (Using Council API)                                                                                                 | Compliance Status                |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **A1. Chain Integrity**         | Run the manual `gla.verify_chain_integrity()` function on a secure shell.                                                             | PASS/FAIL: Must confirm 100% Hash Chain integrity. |
| **A2. Signature Verification**  | Retrieve a sample of 100 recent log entries. For each, confirm the `signature_verified` field is True (unless the entry is a deliberately logged failure, e.g., a Rule 2 rejection). | PASS/FAIL: All valid transactions must show `signature_verified=True`. |
| **A3. Immutability Test**       | Attempt to execute any non-read operation (POST, PUT, DELETE) on Council API endpoints (e.g., `/v1/logs`, `/v1/log/{hash}`).        | PASS/FAIL: Must receive a `405 Method Not Allowed` or similar access denied error. |
| **A4. Failure Logging (Rule 2)**| Query the ledger for entries where `signature_verified` is False. Confirm that each entry corresponds to a deliberate rejection logged by a receiving agent, not a system breach. | PASS/FAIL: All failures must be logged and auditable. |
